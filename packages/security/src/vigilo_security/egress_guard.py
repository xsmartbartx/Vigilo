"""Egress guard: SSRF and DNS-rebinding defense for outbound requests to scan
targets. This is the "component that touches the internet does nothing else"
boundary described in docs/architecture.md — everything here decides whether
a target is safe to connect to; it never itself makes the scanning request.

`packages/probes` (Phase 1) is the actual HTTP client. It must call
`validate_and_pin()` and connect to the returned `pinned_ip` literally,
never re-resolving the hostname between check and connect — that is what
defeats DNS rebinding.
