          <p>
            {brand.name} scans web applications for security and compliance
            issues and reports what it finds. By submitting a URL or
            creating an account, you agree to these terms.

        <section className="space-y-2">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Two tiers of scanning</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Passive tier</strong> is available to anyone: it makes
            only the kind of requests an ordinary visitor or search-engine
            crawler would make against a publicly reachable URL.{" "}
            <strong>Active tier</strong> — including endpoint enumeration and
            deeper probing — is only performed once you have proven, via a
            DNS record, a well-known file, or a meta tag, that you control
            the target. Requesting active tier without a valid proof does
            not fail your scan; it is silently run at passive tier instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may only request active-tier scanning of sites you own or
            are authorized to test. Passive-tier scanning of a third-party
            site does not require the site owner&apos;s consent, but a site
            owner may have their site excluded from scanning at any time —

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Plans and billing</h2>
          <p>
            {brand.name} offers a free plan with limited scans and targets,
            and paid plans with higher limits and additional features.
            Paid plans are billed on a recurring basis through our payment
            provider, Stripe, until canceled. Downgrading or
            canceling takes effect at the end of the current billing
            period; your account&apos;s entitlements are updated automatically
            once the change is confirmed by our billing provider.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">No warranty</h2>
          <p>
            {brand.name} is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis. A passing report
            is not a guarantee that a site is free of security or
            compliance issues — our checks detect a defined set of known
            patterns and are one input into your own judgment, not a
            substitute for it. We are not liable for actions you take, or
            fail to take, based on a report.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>
            You agree not to use {brand.name} to scan targets you are not
            authorized to test at active tier, to attempt to circumvent
            rate limits or authorization checks, or to use the service in a
            way that disrupts it for other users. See our{" "}
